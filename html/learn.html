    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Thanks for installing Discogs Enhancer!</p>

      <p>This is the “Learn” page. Here you will find in-depth explanations on each feature in the extension.</p>

      <h3>How To Use It</h3>
      <p>When you are on Discogs.com click on the extension's icon (the small, black record icon) and the extension’s menu will open. There you can place your mouse over the "?" icon on each feature to read a short description of what it does, or click the switch on the right to enable/disable the feature.</p>

      <p>A green switch means the feature is enabled; a gray switch means it is disabled. Once you enable/disable a feature your preference will be saved until you decide to change it.</p>

      <p>Some features have sub-menus with options. These features are identified by the “>” icon before the feature name. Click on the feature name to open up the sub-menu to enable/disable the feature. For features with options it is recommended that you read their description here in the "Learn" page to fully understand how they work.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can use the search box in the popup menu to search for keywords like "marketplace", "collection", "profile", etc... and it will only show you features that are designed to work in that particular section of Discogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can click on the "?" icons in the popup menu and go directly to the feature's description here in the Learn page.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Adding A Feature: Step 6 -->
    <!--Block Buyers -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="blockBuyers">Block Buyer Shortcuts</h2>
      <p>Adds a "Block Buyer" button to the order invoice page that allows you to block the buyer directly, without having to go into your Seller Settings page.</p>
      <img src="../img/learn/block-buyers.jpg" class="max-width" />
    </div>

    <!--Block Sellers -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="blockSellers">Block Sellers</h2>
      <p>Blocks any seller from showing up in the Marketplace or tags them in red and labels them as "Blocked seller". Names can be easily added or removed. Simply click "Edit list" on the popup menu and follow the instructions.</p>

      <p>The <b>Tag Sellers</b> setting (default) will mark blocked sellers in red while still allowing you to place an order with them.</p>

      <p>The <b>Hide sellers everywhere</b> option will hide all blocked sellers throughout the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>The <b>Hide sellers in the Marketplace</b> option will hide sellers in your Marketplace Wantlist but they will still be visible and marked in red on an individual release page.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/blocked-seller.png" class="max-width" />

      <p><em>Note:</em> This feature will not track seller username changes so if a seller changes their username, you will have to add the new username to the blocklist.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Confirm Before Removing Items -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="confirm-before-removing">Confirm Before Removing Items</h2>

      <p>This feature will prompt you to confirm that you want to remove an item from your Collection after clicking "Remove" when viewing a Release page. If you keep notes on your releases this can help make sure you don't lose them if you mistakenly click "Remove".</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/confirm-before-removing.jpg" class="max-width" />
    </div>

    <!-- contextual menu options -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="contextual-menu">Contextual Menu Options</h2>
      <p>Lets you search Discogs or other online record shops with any text selected on any webpage. Simply highlight some text, right click, and choose the shop you want to search. You can configure which shops you want to use by clicking on the "Contextual Menu" option inside Discogs Enhancer's popup.</p>

      <p>Current selection includes: All Day Records, Bandcamp, Boomkat, Clone, DeeJay, Discogs, Gramaphone, Hardwax, Juno, Kristina Records, Oye, Pacific Beach Vinyl, Phonica, Rush Hour, Sounds Of The Universe and YouTube.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Currency Converter -->
      <h2 id="currencyConverter">Currency Converter</h2>
      <p>Convert between any of the currencies Discogs supports with the on-screen
        Currency Converter.
      </p>

      <p><em class="white">Step 1:</em> Click the '¥ € $' button in the lower-right corner of the screen.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-1.png" />

      <p><em class="white">Step 2:</em> Choose the seller's currency with the select box labeled <i>'Convert'</i>.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-2.png" />

      <p><em class="white">Step 3:</em> Then select your currency by choosing an option from the select box labeled <i>'To'</i>.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-3.png" />

      <p><em class="white">Step 4:</em> Now simply type the value into the box and see your results instantly!</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-4.png" />

      <p>(Price conversions are an estimate and may not match exactly with Discogs' own conversions.)</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="darkTheme">Dark Theme</h2>
      <p>This makes Discogs much easier on the eyes at night... or all the time. Completely re-themed from top to bottom!</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Demand Index -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="demandIndex">Demand Index</h2>
      <p>The Demand Index is a release's <b>Want</b> to <b>Have</b> ratio converted to a percentage. It's meant to give you a quick idea of how much demand there is on a particular release. A negative value means there are more Haves; a positive value means there are more Wants. A value of 0 means there are an equal number of Wants and Haves.</p>
      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/demand-index.jpg" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="editingNotepad">Editing Notepad</h2>

      <p>A Notepad that you can type notes into while editing releases. These notes will be saved across different
        editing and browser sessions.</p>

      <p>The Notepad can be expanded by clicking the flyout tab on the right side of the screen while editing a release,
        master release, artist, label, or images.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/editing-notepad-tab.jpg" />

      <p>From here you can click the "Edit" (✎) button to edit your Notepad...</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/editing-notepad-edit.jpg" />

      <p>and then "Save" (✔) it using the same button</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/editing-notepad-save.jpg" />

      <p>If you paste in a URL, it will be auto-formatted for you and turned into a clickable hyperlink, so that you can click
        on it without needing to manually copy/paste.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/editing-notepad-hyperlink.jpg" />

      <p><em>Note:</em> The notes in the Notepad will be cleared if you clear your Discogs data in your browser, as it is
        stored in
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">Local Storage</a>. It will also not
        be saved if you browse using Private/Incognito mode and then close your browser.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="everlastingCollection">Everlasting Collection</h2>

      <p>The Everlasting Collection feature lets you continously scroll your Collection without having to click "Prev" or
        "Next" as long as you are using the "Text With Covers" or "Text Only" layouts.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can stop Everlasting Collection from loading more results by clicking the Pause button next to
        the <i>"Scroll to:"</i> select box at the top of the page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="everlastingMarketplace">Everlasting Marketplace</h2>

      <p>The Everlasting Marketplace lets you continuously scroll through the Marketplace listings.
         More results are automatically loaded once you reach the bottom of the Marketplace listings.</p>

      <p>If you want to change your Marketplace filter criteria (Currency, Genre, Media Condition, etc &hellip;), click the "Back to top" link and you'll be taken to the filters at the top of the page where you can make your adjustments.</p>

      <img class="w-200" src="../img/learn/everlasting-back-to-top.jpg" />

      <p>Page numbers are inserted between each set of results as you continue to scroll. You can use the "Select Page" select box to quickly navigate between any previously loaded set of results.</p>

      <img class="w-200" src="../img/learn/everlasting-select-page.jpg" />

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can stop Everlasting Marketplace from loading more results by clicking the Pause button at the top.

        <img class="w-200" src="../img/learn/everlasting-pause.jpg" />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="favoriteSellers">Favorite Sellers</h2>
      <p>Save your favorite sellers to a list and their name will have a small blue checkmark icon next to it in the Marketplace. Names can be easily added or removed. Simply click "Edit list" on the popup menu and follow the instructions.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/favorite-seller.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Feedback Notifications -->
      <h2 id="feedbackNotifications">Feedback Notifications</h2>
      <p>The Feedback Notifier monitors your feedback stats for changes and alerts you when a new one shows up.</p>

      <p>Notification badges will appear at the top of the page. "S" for
        <i>Seller</i> notifications and "B" for
        <i>Buyer</i> notifications:</p>
      <img src="../img/learn/feedback-badges.jpg" style="max-width: 125px;"/>

      <p>You can dismiss the notification by hovering over the badge and clicking the "X" that appears:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/feedback-dismissal.png" />

      <p>Or you can click on the submenu and go directly to your Positive, Neutral, or Negative feedback pages:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/feedback-hover.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- filter countries -->
      <h2 id="shippingCountries">Filter Countries</h2>

      <p>Filters items in the Marketplace that ship from specified countries.</p>

      <p>After <a href="/html/filter-shipping-country.html" target="_blank">adding the specified countries to your list</a> you can configure this option in three ways:</p>

      <p><b>1. Include:</b> Only show items in the Marketplace that ship from the countries on the list. Use this option when you only want to buy from one or more countries. For example, it's ideal if you are in the US and are only interested in items that ship from the United States. Enter "United States" on your list and choose the "INCLUDE ITEMS FROM COUNTRIES" radio button.</p>

      <p><b>2. Exclude:</b> Do not show any items in the Marketplace that ship from the countries on the list. Use this option when you do not want to buy items from one or more countries. For example, if you live in Europe but do not want to purchase items that ship from the US, Canada, and Australia, enter "United States", "Canada", and "Australia" on your list and choose the "EXCLUDE ITEMS FROM COUNTRIES" radio button.</p>

      <p><b>3. Currency Filter:</b> Only filter items in the Marketplace when using a Currency Filter. When you enable this option, filtering will only be applied when you use a Currency Filter in the Marketplace: <img src="../img/learn/currency-filter.jpg" class="max-width" style="max-width: 200px;"/></p>

      <p><em>Pro tip:</em>You can toggle the option on/off to show/hide items that have been filtered.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- filter media condition -->
    <div class="feature-block">

      <h2 id="filterMediaCondition">Filter Media Condition</h2>

      <p>Hide all items in the Marketplace that are below a specified media condition.</p>

      <p>For example, if you select <i>"Near Mint"</i>, only
        Mint and Near Mint condition items will be shown. If you select "Very Good", only
        Mint, Near Mint, Very Good Plus, and Very Good items will be shown (etc &hellip;).</p>

      <p>When results have been filtered, you will see a note that says <b>Filtering items below [condition]</b> next to the pagination links.</p>

      <p><em>Pro tip:</em>It's worth noting that this simply hides these items from view. So if there are 25 items per page and 5 of those are hidden, you will only see 20 results on that particular page.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- filter Prices -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="filterPrices">Filter Prices</h2>

      <p>Hides all items that are below a minimum value or above a maximum value in the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>
        <b class="no-highlight">How to use the Filter Prices feature:</b>
      </p>

      <p>First choose your currency from the select box. It must be the same currency you use on Discogs. If you're using the Suggested Prices feature, the value should already be set:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/filter-prices-1.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p>Next, enter a <b>minimum</b> and/or <b>maximum</b> value in each input. You can enter only one if you like.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/filter-prices-2.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p>Then turn the feature on and refresh the page to begin filtering.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/filter-prices-3.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p><em>Important:</em> If you use the <a href="#suggested-prices">Suggested Prices feature</a>, changing the currency value in Filter Prices will also change the currency value in Suggested Prices.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- filter sleeve condition -->
    <div class="feature-block">

      <h2 id="filterSleeveCondition">Filter Sleeve Condition</h2>

      <p>Hide all items in the Marketplace that are below a specified sleeve condition.</p>

      <p>For example, if you select <i>"Near Mint"</i>, only
        items with sleeves in Mint and Near Mint condition will be shown. If you select "Very Good", only
        Mint, Near Mint, Very Good Plus, and Very Good items will be shown (etc &hellip;).</p>

      <p>You can also hide items with "Generic" and "No Cover" sleeve conditions. <em>Note:</em> If you select both "Generic" and "No Cover", items that do not have a sleeve condition listed will also be hidden.</p>

      <p><em>Caution:</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuNoaLVLgzE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Be careful</a> using this feature with the <i>Filter Media Condition</i> feature. Having both of these features active at the same time can hide A LOT of items in the Marketplace.</p>

      <p><em>Pro tip:</em>It's worth noting that this simply hides these items from view. So if there are 25 items per page and 5 of those are hidden, you will only see 20 results on that particular page.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- filter unavailable items-->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="filter-unavailable">Filter Unavailable Items</h2>

      <p>Hides items in the Marketplace if they are unavailable in your country.</p>
      <!-- <img src="../img/learn/feature-image.png" class="max-width" /> -->
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Fix blurry gallery images -->
      <h2 id="blurry">Fix Blurry Gallery Images</h2>

      <p>If you've ever noticed that some scanned release images have blurry text, this option should fix it.</p>

      <p>This will only work on monitors that are not HD so if you use a 4k display or have a Retina screen, you won't see any improvement.</p>

      <p>Please be aware that by enabling this option, you may notice the images "jump" a bit when clicking the zoomed in view. This is a side effect of the way that the extension repositions the image so that it is no longer blurry.</p>

      <p>If you would like a more detailed explaination of how this feature works, please see <a href="https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/759801?page=1#7536285">this post.</a>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Hide Min, Median, Max columns -->
      <h2 id="hideColumns">Hide Min, Median, Max Columns</h2>
      <p>This hides the Min, Median, Max columns in the collection page. Helpful if you'd like more space when viewing your collection.</p>

      <h2 id="inventory-ratings">Inventory Ratings</h2>
      <p>Marks an item's rating in red if it is above the value set in the option when viewing a seller's inventory.</p>
      <p>Useful for when you are simply browsing a seller's inventory for items that are not on your Wantlist but might be worth checking out.</p>
      <img src="../img/learn/inventory-ratings.jpg" class="max-width"/>

      <p>To set a value, click on the feature name to open the submenu. Enter the minimum rating value a release should exceed in order to be tagged in red. Then turn the option on and refresh your page.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Inventory Scanner -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="inventoryScanner">Inventory Scanner</h2>
      <p>The Inventory Scanner is a feature for Sellers that will scan a single page of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/manage" target="_blank">your inventory</a> and mark any release that is a set percentage below the median Marketplace price.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> I have only tested this with listings in USD. If you use a different currency and have issues please let me know!</p>

      <p>This will add a button to the nav bar that will show you a random item from your collection when clicked.</p>

      <p>The functionality is identical to the "Random Item" feature in the Collection page but allows you to access it from the nav bar rather than going back to the Collection page and clicking "Random Item" again.</p>

      <p>You have to be logged in for this feature to work.</p>

      <h2 id="releaseScanner">Release Scanner</h2>

      <p>This will "scan" a single page of releases and count the number of comments on each release on any Artist or Label page. Think of it as a quick way to get an idea of which releases are being talked about. Once a page has been scanned, release links will open in a new tab/window.</p>

      <p>If there are comments on a release a small gray badge with the number of comments will be appended to the release. If there are no comments, nothing is appended.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/scan-badge.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p>To scan a page of releases click the "Scan Releases" button near the top portion of the page:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/scan-button.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> You can hover over the badge to see the rating and number of votes each releases has received. Clicking the badge will open the release in a new tab.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> Scanning is rate-limited to 1 scan per second in accordance with <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:home,header:home-rate-limiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discogs' rate-limiting rules.</a></p>

      <p>You can toggle between the actual and relative dates by clicking on the date. Your preference will be saved each time you toggle between either format.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/absolute-date-international.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p>You can also show the actual date using the US date format. Click the "Use US date format" checkbox in the extension's submenu and refresh the page.</p>

        <p>Adds a shopping cart icon next to any seller's name in the Marketplace when you have items of theirs in your cart.</p>

        <p>Why would you want to use this? Well, if you're like me, you put a lot of items in your cart as you browse and leave them there for days/weeks on end. If that's the case, when you use this feature you'll be able to immediately know if you already have an item from this seller in your cart which can help you save on shipping costs.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="sort-buttons">Sort Buttons</h2>

      <p>This adds <span class="sort-btn">Sort A-Z</span> buttons on all kinds of things. You can sort the dialog boxes on the Explore page, your personal lists in the 'Add to list' dialog boxes, and any filter within the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>The first click sorts A-Z, the second click sorts Z-A and the third click returns the list to its original state (aka undo).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Suggested Prices -->
      <h2 id="suggested-prices">Suggested Prices</h2>

      <p>Shows the prices that Discogs suggests and compares them to the seller's price. It's useful for seeing if an item is priced fairly. <b>In order for this to work you must be registered as a seller.</b></p>

      <p>
        <b class="no-highlight">How to use the Suggested Prices feature:</b>
      </p>

      <p>First choose your currency from the select box. It must be the same currency you use on Discogs:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/prices-step-2.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>Next, turn the option on:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/prices-step-3.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>For release pages, the comparisons are displayed automatically.</p>

      <p>For pages like <b>Wantlists,</b> <b>Seller pages,</b> or <b>Master Releases</b>, a link is inserted into the page:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/price-link.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>Clicking this link will show the comparison for that particular listing:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/price-example.png" class="price-example" />

      <p>Results are displayed in the currency that is set in your Seller settings on Discogs.</p>

      <p><b>Because currencies shift due to global market fluctuations and release prices shift due to market demand, the recommended price may differ from the listed price.</b></p>

      <p>Exchange rate data is calculated every two hours (except on weekends when Markets are closed). Discogs uses a different exchange service so their exchange rates might differ slightly from Discogs Enhancers' rates. Use and interpret at your own risk. Please don't use it as an excuse to be a jerk to sellers.</p>

      <p><em>Important:</em> If you use the <a href="#filterPrices">Filter Prices feature</a>, changing the currency value in Suggested Prices will also change the currency value in Filter Prices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Tag Seller Reputation -->

      <img src="../img/learn/seller-rep.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>You can also choose one of seven different tag colors.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/seller-rep-tag-color.png" class="max-width" />
